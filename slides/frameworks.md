# Design Frameworks

---

# Warmup

* Clone down the directory linked in your cohort channel.
* What resources do you use to explore new technologies/frameworks?
* If I told you that we were going to use Materialize or Bootstrap today, and you had no idea what that meant, what would you do?

---

# Wireframing

* Diagramming what you want a website to look like
* Don't need fancy tools, but they exist
* Goal for today

--

# Materialize

* Design Framework
* Gives us boilerplate CSS and JS that we can use to style our pages

---

# How do I Install it?

* With a partner, see if you can find instructions on how to install Materialize.
* How did you find the instructions? What do you notice as you read the them?
* How would you install this in a Rails project?

---

# Nav Bar

* With your partner, see if you can find information on how to add a nav bar.
* Try it!

---

# Cards & Footer

* Add three cards to your layout.
* Add a footer
* See if you can get the cards to sit next to each other (hint, look at the materialize documentation for their Grid system)

---

# Extensions

* Change the color of the header and footer
* Remove the links from the last card
* See if you can add a navigation pane to the left of your cards, but below the nav and above the footer.
